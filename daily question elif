# One way to classify the languages of the 
# world is by looking at their morphological 
# systems. One classification is based on the 
# index of synthesis that reflects the average 
# number of morphemes in a word. The values vary 
# between 1 and 4 and there are 3 types of 
# languages according to that system. Here 
# they are:
# Type — Index
# Analytic — less than 2
# Synthetic — from 2 to 3 (inclusively)
# Polysynthetic — more than 3

# Write a program that given the index of synthesis determines the type of the language.

# The input format:
# The value of the index of synthesis.

# The output format:
# The type of language.

num_value = float(input())

if num_value < 2 and num_value >= 1:
    print("Analytic")
if num_value >= 2 and num_value <= 3:
    print("Synthetic")
if num_value > 3 and num_value < 4:
    print("Polysynthetic")
